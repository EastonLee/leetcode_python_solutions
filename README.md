LeetCode is a fascinating website where you can challenge yourself with various programming algorithm problems and meeting brilliant people who can come up with mind-blowing solutions. In here you can refine your algorithm knowledge and sharpen your programming mind.

I've solved many problems, but many times when I come to face old problems again I can't immediately recall my previous solutions. So I collect my finished solutions here, some accompanied with other users' better solutions (I give the reference link and authors' user name), to give myself a place to look back.
